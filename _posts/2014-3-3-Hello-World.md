title: Week 1: Data Science Dropout
---

Welcome to my blog! Here's a quick rundown of what I'll be talking about on this blog:

My name is Zach, and I'm a Data Science Fellow at Metis, a 3-month immersive bootcamp teaching about data science, machine learning, and all sorts of interesting ways data can be collected (or scraped), modeled and interpreted. They are based in New York, but also have a campus in downtown San Francisco (where I am); shout out to DevBootCamp, who we share space with and see everyday. Full disclosure: we are required to keep a blog, but I've written blogs on my work/research before, so I'm into it.

Now that you know why I'm starting this blog and what I'll be posting about, I'll talk a little bit about myself. I'm a college dropout, and the only person in my cohort without at least a bachelor's degree, though a significant number of my peers also have Master's degrees or PhDs. But I'm not-so-secretly an autodidact. As an example, when I lived in Colorado and sushi was not a viable restaurant choice, I taught myself how to make sushi via Google, while in a grocery store at 1am; I googled a couple recipes, bought the supplies, went home and was eating sushi within two hours. There really is nothing Google cannot teach when the student has the drive to learn and discover. 


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
